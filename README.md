Made this as a, guess what, freecodecamp's certifiation project.

I think I did pretty good, well for my standards at least, still not the best though.

I still need to improve my responsive and accessbility skills. Using this on mobile or using a screen reader for this must be absolute torture.

I actually got around to splitting the HTML and CSS files instead of a large txt file. Will start doing this from now on.

Buy my spoons, or else...
